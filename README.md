# Tic-Tac-Toe 

## Overview
A customizable NxN Tic-Tac-Toe game with adjustable board size, winning conditions, and an AI opponent.  
The game supports both **Player vs Player** and **Player vs AI** modes.  
The AI is designed to recognize winning opportunities and block the opponent, making matches more challenging and fun.

This is a personal pet project I developed in my free time, in which I implemented a custom AI opponent.

## Features
- Choose board size up to **6x6**
- Set your own winning condition (e.g., 4 in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- Play against a friend or test yourself against an AI opponent
- Smart AI logic that recognizes simple winning opportunities and prevents easy wins
- Responsive UI for smooth gameplay experience
